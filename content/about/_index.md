## Hi, I’m Jannis

My name is **Jannis Karpinski**. I live in Germany and work as a social worker in youth care.  
Alongside my professional life, programming has been part of who I am since my youth.

I have always approached programming as a space for experimentation. Over the years, I started many projects, explored different ideas, and learned a lot along the way — even if many of those projects were never fully finished. That pattern is visible on my GitHub, and it reflects how I learn: by building, rethinking, and sometimes letting things go.

## How I Work

Programming is not my job — it is something I do because I enjoy understanding systems and figuring things out. I don’t aim for perfect solutions or “the right way” of doing things. I believe that most problems can be solved in many valid ways.

In recent years, I have gravitated strongly towards **Go**. Its simplicity and pragmatic design fit well with how I like to think and work, and it has become the language I mainly use for new ideas and experiments.

## Why This Blog Exists

This blog exists for **one single project**: documenting the process of building a decentralized voice chat application.

It is not meant to be a general programming blog.  
It is not a tutorial series.  
It is not a polished showcase.

The blog is a written trace of my thinking, learning, and decision-making while working on this project. I explain concepts as far as I understand them, justify the approaches I choose, and document how things evolve over time.

The code itself lives in the *auraspeak* organization on GitHub. I won’t repeat everything here — the blog and the repositories are meant to complement each other.

## What to Expect

This blog may move slowly.  
It may change direction.  
It may stop at some point.

That is not the intention, but it is a realistic possibility. Programming is a hobby for me, and this project grows as long as time, curiosity, and motivation allow it.

What you read here is shared intentionally — no more and no less.

## Closing

This page exists so you know who is behind the code and the writing.  
Everything else on this site documents the journey of building this one project.

Thanks for reading.
